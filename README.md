## Project Overview

SnapSound goes beyond monotonous text-to-audio conversion by adding speech modulation, emphasis, and natural pacing to create engaging podcast content. It utilizes multi-agent systems and advanced AI models to understand context and generate conversational audio output.

## Technical Flow

SnapSound processes your content through six key stages:

1. **Upload File (Any Format)** - Users upload files in various formats like PDF, PPTX, DOCX, or other documents to the system for processing.

2. **Image Conversion & OCR Processing** - Each page/slide is converted to an image, and OCR + AI Vision models extract text, diagrams, and relevant visual content.

3. **Context Understanding & Summarization** - AI analyzes the extracted content, understands diagrams and key points, and summarizes lengthy sections for structured narration.

4. **AI Audio Conversion & Instructions** - Generates a natural speech script with GPT-4.5 for natural conversation, incorporating audio instructions and structured insights for engaging narration.

5. **Audio Processing & Optimization** - Enhances audio clarity, removes background noise, and adjusts tone and speed using multimodal LLM (GPT-4oTTS) for better listening experience.

6. **Export & Sharing** - Users can download the podcast audio locally or publish directly to platforms like Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

## Core Implementation Details

### 1. File Handling & Extraction
- For PDFs & PPTs: Convert pages/slides into images
- Use Transformer-based MOE mistral OCR to extract text
- Image recognition models analyze diagrams and tables
- For Audio Inputs: FFmpeg extracts text via speech-to-text (Whisper API or Vosk) if needed

### 2. AI Processing & Summarization
- Context Understanding:
  - Uses transformer-based models LLM with trillion parameter GPT-4.5 for natural conversation
  - Diagrams converted to spoken descriptions using vision models

### 3. Speech Generation & Enhancement
- Uses GPT-4oTTS with instruction finetuning
- Adjusts pitch, speed, and tone to create a human-like experience
- FFmpeg/Web Audio API further optimizes clarity, removes noise, adjusts pace

### 4. Podcast Export & Publishing
- Users can download or directly upload to:
  - Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, YouTube Audio
  - Custom RSS feeds

## Frontend Preview

The user interface consists of a clean, intuitive design with two main sections:

### Source Section
- "DEMO AUDIO" button with play icon
- "UPLOAD" button for adding custom audio files
- Input field for "Audio Name (optional)"
- URL input field for adding audio via link
- "Add" and "Cancel" buttons

### Player Section
- Audio player interface with standard playback controls
- Progress bar showing current playback position
- Time indicators showing current position and total duration
- "CC" button for captions
- "AI" label indicating AI functionality

### Process Flow Visualization

The system works through this process:

1. **Image** - Source document/slide is processed
2. **OCR (Text)** - Text is extracted from images
3. **Conversation** - AI generates a conversational script
4. **Audio** - Final audio is produced and optimized

```
